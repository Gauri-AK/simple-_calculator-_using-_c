A basic calculator is one of the most fundamental and introductory projects in C programming. It introduces a variety of key programming concepts such as user input, decision-making through conditional statements, and basic mathematical operations. The simplicity of this project makes it ideal for beginners, while its potential for expansion allows more advanced learners to explore additional features, such as error handling, input validation, or more complex calculations.
At its core, the basic calculator in C is a console-based application. The user interacts with the program by providing two numbers (operands) and an arithmetic operator, which specifies the operation to be performed. The four primary arithmetic operations supported by this calculator are:

	•	Addition (+)
	•	Subtraction (-)
	•	Multiplication (*)
	•	Division (/)

These operations reflect the most commonly used mathematical calculations, making the program practical for everyday use. Upon entering the numbers and the operator, the program computes the result and displays it to the user.
